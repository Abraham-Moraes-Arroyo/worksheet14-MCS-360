Run build-max-heap(A) on the follwing array.  See lecture 27 for the precice algorithm:

A = 4,1,4,2,16,9,10,14,8,7

What is the time complexity of Heapify?  What is the space complexity?

Using the same array A as above, show all steps in the heapsort algorithm for sorting A.  What is the time complexity of heapsort?  What is the best possible time complexity of any comparison sort?  Why?

Consider the sentence "this is week fourteen.". Ignoring spaces and ".", generate Huffman code and show all the stages of a priority queue used during the code generation. 

If the priority queue above is implemented as a minimum heap, draw the heap for each stage of the priority queue
